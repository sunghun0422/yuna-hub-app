# 🗂 Handoff Memo HISTORY
**Subject:** Transition from _YeoSi YunaHub 11 → YeoSi YunaHub 12_  
**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Author:** Lee Sung Hun (Director / System Owner)  
**System:** Yuna Hub Pro – Vercel / GitHub Integration  

---

## 1️⃣ Background
- _YeoSi YunaHub 11_ served as the **first unified hub** integrating memory, story, and business flows.  
- Over time the room reached context saturation and manual data duplication (20 original files).  
- To ensure stability, persistence, and backend automation, _YeoSi YunaHub 12_ was launched as a successor.  

---

## 2️⃣ Purpose of Transition
- Secure long-term memory and record continuity beyond ChatGPT session limits.  
- Migrate all historical dialogues and documents to external repositories (GitHub + Vercel).  
- Establish Yuna Hub Pro as the backend engine for indexing, summarization, and API serving.
